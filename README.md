# charges
Simulates electric potential and field around charges of arbitrary shape using the finite element method.

## Simulation
Uses electric field of point charge equation.

All structures have linearly distributed charge.

Simple charge structures such as finite line segments and circles of charges are simulated with numerical integration.
