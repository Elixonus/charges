# charges

Simulates electric potential and field around charges of arbitrary shape using finite discretization methods.

## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python charges/<charges_example>
```

where `<charges_example>` is the file name of the program you want to run.

## Simulation

Uses electric field of point charge equation.

All structures have linearly distributed charge.

Simple charge structures such as finite line segments and circles of charges are simulated with numerical integration.
